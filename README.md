# Analysis of Sleep Health and Lifestyle Factors
## Overview of the dataset
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the [Sleep health dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset) from Kaggle.
## Problem Statement
1. Identify the key factors influencing sleep health.
2. Analyze the relationship between lifestyle factors and sleep quality.
3. Provide actionable insights for improving sleep health.
## Challenges faced
1. Handling missing or inconsistent data.
2. Ensuring accurate representation of diverse occupations.
3. Balancing the scope of analysis with the available data.
## Softwares Used to Carry out the Analysis
- Python for data analysis and visualization.
- Pandas for data manipulation.
- Seaborn and Matplotlib for plotting graphs.
- PowerPoint for presenting findings.
## Unforeseen Circumstances
- Unavailability of certain detailed health metrics.
- Time constraints in performing extensive analysis.
- Variability in self-reported data affecting consistency.
## Methodology
- Data Cleaning and normalization.
- Descriptive statistics to summarize the data.
- Correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables.
- Group comparisons to explore differences across categories.
- Visualization to effectively communicate insights.
## KeY Findings
### Sleep Duration and Quality:
- The average sleep duration among individuals varies significantly across different occupations.
- There is a noticeable correlation between physical activity levels and sleep quality, with higher activity levels generally associated with better sleep quality.
- High stress levels are linked to poorer sleep quality, indicating that stress management is crucial for improving sleep health.
### Gender and Sleep
The distribution of sleep duration and quality does not
show significant gender differences, suggesting that other factors such as occupation and lifestyle choices may have a more substantial impact on sleep health
### Impact of BMI and Physical Activity
Higher BMI categories (overweight and obese) are linked to shorter sleep duration and lower sleep quality, while increased physical activity is associated with longer sleep duration and better sleep quality.
### Sleep Disorders
- Individuals with sleep disorders, such as sleep
apnea, report significantly lower sleep quality and shorter sleep duration compared to those without sleep disorders.
- There is a clear need for targeted interventions for
individuals with sleep disorders to enhance their sleep health
## Recommendations
### Promote Physical Activity:
- Encourage regular exercise to improve sleep duration and quality.
- Implement workplace wellness programs.
### Stress Management:
- Develop stress management programs like mindfulness and meditation.
- Offer resources for managing stress in professional and personal settings.
### Support for High-Risk Groups:
- Provide specialized support for individuals with higher BMI and sleep disorders.
- Consider medical consultations and tailored sleep plans.
### Raise Awareness:
Educate on the importance of sleep health and healthy sleep practices.
Promote consistent sleep schedules and sleep-friendly environments.
### Workplace Adjustments:
Offer flexible working hours and rest periods.
Encourage a balanced work-life approach to reduce stress and improve sleep
